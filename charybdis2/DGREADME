     The following two features can be implemented in CHARYBDIS2 by
     defining the preprocessor flag GINGRICH at compile time (compiler 
     option -DGINGRICH).

     Graviton bulk emission and black hole recoil according to
     JHEP0711:064,2007 (arXiv:0706.0623 [hep-ph]).

     MSSDEC additional decay option, 4= all SM particles + bulk
            gravitons [3] 

     DGTENSION brane tension used in black hole recoil calculation. If 
            DGSB=.TRUE. DGTENSION is automatically calculated [1000.] 

     String ball production and decay according to
     Phys.Rev.D78:115009,2008 (arXiv:0808.2512 [hep-ph]). 

     DGSB   flag that turns on option for string ball production and
            decay [F] 

     DGMS   the string scale (GeV) [1000.]

     DGGS   string coupling. Only values in range (0,1) make sense
            [0.3] 

     When running the CHARYBDIS code with the string ball flag set
     there are several features within the program which hinder one's
     ability to obtain interpretable results.  To ensure that the
     physical processes involved with string balls are represented
     properly it is generally important to follow a few explicit
     guidelines and ensure the appropriate options are set properly.  

     The following logical parameters should be turned OFF.
    
     KINCUT=.FALSE. this causes earlier than optimal termination of
                    string ball decays.
 
     BHSPIN=.FALSE. string balls with spin have not yet been
                    implemented. Also should not be used with bulk
                    graviton emissions (MSSDEC=4).

     NBODYAVERAGE=.FALSE. not yet tested for string balls.

     The following Logical parameters should be turned ON.

     RMBOIL=.TRUE. inclusion of the boiling remnant model is necessary
                   to ensure string ball decay is continued until the
                   string scale is reached. 
	
     NBODYPHASE=.TRUE. convolution of the phase space of decay with
                       any product of Hawking angular spectra is not
                       applicable for random walk phases of string
                       ball decay.  Hence the phase spaced used should
                       be pure.  

     It is important to ensure that the following conditions are met
     by the code before running it. 
 
     THWMAX=DGMS Prevent temperature larger than the fundamental string 
                 scale. 

     RMMINM=DGMS The model of decay used for string balls is not
                 applicable below DGMS.  Since RMBOIL=.TRUE. for string
                 balls RMMINM needs to be set to string scale.

     MPLNCK.GT.DGMS Planck scale larger than string scale is tested
                    assumption. 

     MINMSS.GT.DGMS string balls not allowed below string scale.

     RECOIL=2 only this option has been tested for string balls.
