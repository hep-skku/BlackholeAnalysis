    This  is  the  documentation  for release 2.001 of  the  Black  Hole
    generator CHARYBDIS.

    THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION, NOT FOR GENERAL RELEASE.

    The  code is  designed  to run  either  standalone, with  HERWIG  or
    PYTHIA. There are a few things which need to be set up.

    You should have the following code:

    charybdis2001.F the code for the black hole generator;

    maincharybdis.f example main program for CHARYBDIS;
    mainpythia.f example main program for PYTHIA;
    mainherwig.f example main program for HERWIG.

    charybdis2001.inc    include file for the black hole event generator

    In  addition to  this  you  will  also  need  a Les  Houches  accord
    compliant version  of either HERWIG  or PYTHIA with  both  the dummy
    Les  Houches  routines  UPINIT  and  UPEVNT   and the  dummy  PDFLIB
    subroutines  PDFSET and  STRUCTM  deleted.  For  HERWIG  this  means
    version 6.500  and above, for PYTHIA  you will need a  version above
    6.200.

    Finally, you  will  need the  data files  provided to be placed in a
    directory named data_files/ inside your execution directory.

    In the Les Houches routines the beams are specified as follows:

    IDBMUP(1),IDBMUP(2) PDG  codes for the beam  particles (only protons
    and antiprotons allowed) [2212,2212]
    EBMUP(1),EBMUP(2) energies of the beam particles [7000.,7000.]
    Square brackets show the default values. In the HERWIG version, they
    are  overwritten with the values deduced from the  HERWIG parameters
    PART1, PART2 and PBEAM1, PBEAM2, so  they  must  be  set in the main 
    program before HERWIG is called (see comments in mainherwig.f). 
    However in  the  PYTHIA or standalone versions  they  must be  reset  
    explicitly in COMMON/HEPRUP/ if changed.

    The CHARYBDIS parameters available to the user are as follows.  They
    have the default values  indicated,  all of  which may be changed in
    the main program, as shown in the samples mainpythia and mainherwig. 

    MPLNCK the Planck Mass [1000.]

    MSSDEF whose  definition  of the  Planck  Mass  you are  using - see
           Appendix A of hep-ph/0110127 for a comparison [2]

    TOTDIM the total number of dimensions (i.e. 4+extra) [6]

    GTSCA  sets momentum scale for calling the PDFs (.TRUE. is using the
           inverse Schwarzschild  radius  and .FALSE. is using sqrt(s) -
           see  discussion on p12  of hep-ph/0106219  but note  that the
           cross  sections  in  this  paper  were  NOT  calculated  with
           GTSCA=.TRUE. even though it suggests they were) [F]

    MINMSS the minimum mass of the black holes to be produced [5000.]
 
    MAXMSS the maximum mass of the black holes to be produced [14000.]

    NBODY  the  number  of particles  produced in the decay of the black
           hole remnant [2]
  
    TIMVAR time  variation  of  the  Black  Hole's  Hawking  temperature
           (.TRUE. is on .FALSE. is off) [T]

    MSSDEC the type of particles to  produce in the decay, 1= only light
           SM  particles, 2= light SM  particles + top W/Z and 3= all SM
           particles [3]

    GRYBDY controls the use of the gray body  factors, for  GRYBDY=.TRUE.
           the correct  D-dimensional gray body factors are used whereas
           for GRYBDY=.FALSE. the black body spectrum is used (Note that
           GRYBDY=.FALSE.  only  works  in  the  non-spinning case - See 
           BHSPIN switch below) [T]

    KINCUT controls  the  termination  of  the  evaporation  phase.  For
           KINCUT=.TRUE.  the  evaporation  phase  terminates   when  an
           emission is selected with energy  greater than the black hole
           mass  whereas for  KINCUT=.FALSE.  the  evaporation phase  is
           terminated  when the mass of the  black hole  remnant is less
           than the Planck mass [F]

    YRCSEC controls whether the Yoshino-Rychkov  enhancement factors are
           used in computing the cross section (see Phys.Rev.D71:104028,
           2005 [hep-th/0503171]) [T]

    THWMAX maximum value of the  Hawking temperature (GeV).  If a larger
           value is generated during decay, it is reset to this  [1000.]

    RMBOIL controls whether to use the "boiling remnant" model, in which
           the black hole decay continues  below the Planck scale,  with
           temperature limited by  THWMAX.  (This option is inconsistent
           with the use of KINCUT=.TRUE.) [F]

    RMMINM minimum remnant mass. If the "boiling remnant" model is used,
           this should be less than MPLNCK, otherwise it is set equal to
           MPLNCK if smaller [100.]

    BHSPIN controls inclusion of black hole spin effects [T]

    BHJVAR if BHSPIN=.TRUE.,  allows spin axis of the black hole to vary
           during decay [T]

    BHANIS if BHSPIN=.TRUE., controls inclusion of the anisotropy of the
           angular distribution  of emitted particles, through the  used
           of appropriate angular functions [T]

    MJLOST Controls  the  use of  a model  for loss  of mass and angular 
           momentum during production, build up from the allowed regions
           on  the (M,J)  plane  computed  in  Phys.Rev.D71:104028, 2005
           [hep-th/0503171] [T]

    FMLOST Controls  the  amount  of recoil between the black hole after 
           formation,  and  the  gravitational  radiation  it loses when  
           MJLOST=.TRUE.. (No recoil --> FMLOST=1D0). A small recoil  is
           is necessary in the HERWIG implementation to avoid  numerical
           problems [0.99D0] 

    RMSTAB Option to include a stable remnant by the end of  the  decay.
           Only  electrical  charges  +1,  -1 or 0  and  baryon  number
           conserving remnants allowed [.FALSE.]    

    RECOIL Uses two different models for the recoil. RECOIL=1 interprets 
           the energy selected as the energy of the emission in the rest
           frame of the BH  before  emission,  RECOIL=2  interprets  the 
           selected energy as the reduction in mass of the BH [2] 
          
    NBODYAVERAGE Use an estimate for the expectation value of the number 
           of emissions <N> (as given by the Hawking spectrum)  at  each 
           stage  of  the  evaporation,  as  a  criterion  to  stop  the 
           evaporation (example if <N> < NBODY-1 stop) [T] 

    NBODYVAR   Use  a  Poisson  distribution  with  <N>  to  select  the 
           multiplicity  of the remnant decay on an event by event basis
           [F] 

    NBODYPHASE If .TRUE. use pure phase space for the remnant decay,  if
           .FALSE. use phase space convoluted with a product of  Hawking
           angular spectra for each of the  particles  selected  for the 
           decay [F]

    SKIP2REMNANT Option to skip evaporation and use a remnant model only
           [F] 

    IBHPRN print out option 0= no  printout, 1= errors only, 2= errors +
           info [1]

    LHEFILENAME Name of the lhouches xml file where the events are stored. 
           (must be 8 characters long) [lhouches]

    In  the  Makefile  you must  specify  which  general  purpose  event
    generator, i.e.

    GENERATOR = CHARYBDIS (standalone)
    GENERATOR = HERWIG  for HERWIG
    GENERATOR = PYTHIA  for PYTHIA

    whether or not you want PDFLIB or LHAPDF to be used

    PDFCHOICE = PDFLIB  for PDFLIB
    PDFCHOICE = LHAPDF  for LHAPDF (only works for standalone charybdis)
    PDFCHOICE =         otherwise.

    You  must also  specify the name of the HERWIG/PYTHIA source and the
    location of the PDFLIB or LHAPDF library, if used  by  setting  LPDF 
    (see examples in the Makefile)

    In the HERWIG version the black hole entry in the event  record  has
    been assigned the provisional PDG code IDHEP=40 with name 'BlacHole'.
    Similarly, the graviton as been  asigned  IDHEP=39  and  the  stable 
    remnants, 50 and +/- 51 for neutral and charged respectively.   
    However this has not been implemented in the PYTHIA version.

    After event generation, the black hole decay history may be found in
    the common block BHDHIS, as follows:

      PBHD(1-5,n) = 5-momentum (px,py,pz,E,m) of BH before nth emission
      SBHD(1-3,n) = spin 3-vector of BH in its r.f. before nth emission
      RHBHD(n),OBBHD(n),OMBHD(n),THBHD(n),NFLUXBHD(n) = horizon radius,
      oblateness, angular velocity, Hawking temperature and total flux
      before  nth emission;
      NBHD = number of entries in decay history.  Thus n=NBHD gives the
      state of the BH before the final NBODY remnant decay.

    N.B. The momenta  PBHD are those before parton showering,  which may
    differ from those reconstructed from the decay products after parton
    showering, owing to momentum reshuffling to conserve 4-momentum.
  
    N.B.2 Memory allocation has been prepared for a TeV scale  model  at 
    LHC energies. If you attempt to push beam  energies up,  the program
    will isse error messages instructing you to increase array sizes.

    This version has  been checked  for compatibility  with a variety of
    Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 compilers.
